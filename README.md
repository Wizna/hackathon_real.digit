# Hackathon (real.digit)
This is the front end for our team Phoenix in RWTH Hackathon 2018.

We worked on Challenge 1, from real.digit.

This is a simple tickets system, a single page application. Read data from database, synchronizing status with the Order server.

I coded for the front end, using bootstrap and Socket.IO

We won the 2nd place, although there were only 3 teams : )
